# raypack

Raypack will create a package for AWS Glue, Ray.io tasks. This automates
this [documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/edit-script-ray-env-dependencies.html) that has
some handwavy descriptions of shell commands.

If you are only using included-by-default packages, public packages, pure python packages,
binary wheel packages, you don't have to do this.

AWS Glue can't handle anything without a binary wheel or private package repositories, gcc or other build tools are not
in Glue runtime images.

So you have build on a machine that matches the AWS runtime OS (Fedora-like), create a virtual directory,
and then zip it up and upload it to s3.

raypack is not supported by Amazon, AWS, nor Anyscale, Inc the makers of ray.io.

![Libraries.io dependency status for latest release](https://img.shields.io/librariesio/release/pypi/raypack) [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/raypack/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/raypack/month)

## Installation

You are encouraged to install with pipx so that the CLI tools dependencies do not conflict with your project
dependencies.

```shell
pipx install raypack
```

## Capabilities

- Calls poetry to create a virtualenv without dev dependencies
- TODO: support pip, pipenv to create virtualenv.
- Finds site-packages
- Zips virtualenv and zips own package
- TODO: support single file modules, eg. mymodule.py
- Skips cruft
- Run as few subprocesses as possible
- config using pyproject.toml or CLI args
- TODO: Uploads to s3
- pipx installable
- works on any OS as well as is possible (can't handle linux binaries on windows for example)

## Usage

```bash
raypack
```

```bash
python -m raypack
```

Configuration. If none specified, defaults are as below.
```toml
[tool.raypack]
exclude_packaging_cruft = true
outer_folder_name = "venv"
source_venv = ".venv"
venv_tool = "poetry"
```

## Contributing

To install and run tests and linting tools.
```bash
poetry install --with dev
make check
```

To see if the app can package up other apps
```bash
poetry build
# exist poetry shell so that pipx can install with the right base python
exit 
pipx install /e/github/raypack/dist/raypack-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
And then in a different project with a `pyproject.toml` file, run

```bash
raypack
```

## Prior Art

[Random scripts in comments](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1937#issuecomment-983754739)

Similar to PEX or other venv zip tools, which as far as I know are not AWS aware, or they don't include all the
dependencies, or they are more interested in making the archive file executable or self-extracting.

AWS Lambdas also have to go through a similar ad hoc zip process.
